# CRUD REST API in Spring Boot
### The project creates a CRUD Rest Api using Spring boot, MongoDB, and Docker. The code has a RestController for the student class with Get Post Put and Delete Methods. Each method returns a Student Object in JSON along with a HTTP Response Code.
## How to Use:
### This Project requires Spring Boot and Docker in Intellij. Clone the github and open in Intellij then run the docker-compose.yaml file to start the MongoDb Database which runs locally on your computer. Then run the main method in DemoApplication class. 
### Once running you can use Intellij's built in HTTP Request Client or Use Postman to Query the Database.
